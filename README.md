When he’s not trying to read all of the comics ever Matthew spends his time editing for the graphic novel review site No Flying No Tights, organizing (or participating in) gaming events (he’s Vespidae), helping to run the Zine Pavilion, making the fiction anthology zine Two-Fisted Librarians, and playing with Raspberry Pi computers and maker/technology stuff in general. He’s also willing to talk about why libraries are bad at cataloguing graphic novels for basically forever (or until they get better at it).
